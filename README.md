## Overview

Welcome to the repository of the Hotel Booking Cancellation Data Analysis project! The goal of this project is a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking cancellations with the help of Excel. The dataset has important columns that can give useful insights into the various trends and factors affecting hotel bookings and cancellations.

## Dataset Columns

- `hotel`: Type of hotel (e.g., Resort Hotel, City Hotel)
- `is_canceled`: Cancellation status (0 for not canceled, 1 for canceled)
- `arrival_date_year`: Year of arrival
- `arrival_date_month`: Month of arrival
- ... (other columns listed)

## Project Tasks

1. Problem Statement in Business Context: The journey begins with a deep dive into the hotel booking business and an understanding of how cancellations affect the business.

2. Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned, fixing missing values, removing outliers, and making sure it is formatted to perform proper analysis.

3. Pivot Tables and Charts: Created visualizations to analyze the following: - Cancellations based on marital status.
- Cancellations based on room availability.
- Monthly trends in cancellations.
- Cancellation rates compared between different hotel types.

4. Interactive Dashboard: Built a user-friendly dashboard to visually present the key insights from the analysis.
